# Karatsuba-Algorithm
C++ Implementation of Integer Addition, Multiplication, and Division

1.Task Description
    You are asked to use C++ to implement:
    1) School Method for Integer Addition and Karatsuba Algorithm for Integer Multiplication
    2) Integer Division 
2 Submission Guideline
    Your program needs to perform three calculations on three given integers: I1, I2, and B.

    Sum Calculation:
    Add I1 and I2 using the school method in base B.

    Product Calculation:
    Multiply I1 and I2 using the Karatsuba algorithm in base B.

    Ratio Calculation:
    Calculate the floor division of I1 by I2 and present the result in base B.(rounded down)
    
    Sample input 1: 101 5 10
    Sample output 1: 106 505 20
    Sample input 2: 10 111 2
    Sample output 2: 1001 1110 0
    Sample input 3: 111 10 2
    Sample output 2: 1001 1110 11
